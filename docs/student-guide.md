## Starting a workout

When you first open your workout landing page, the workout status will probably show **STOPPED**. To start a workout, you simply click **START WORKOUT**. The workout will then change to **WORKING** until the servers have all successfully started. Then, a button will show to **ENTER YOUR WORKOUT!**

## Logging in

After starting, first, copy the workout password and remember the username, and then click the button to enter your workout. A new tab will open to a login screen from Apache Guacamole. Here, you’ll enter your username and copy your password. After a few seconds, your desktop will show up. Now you can start your workout!

## Performing Your Workout

Workout instructions are usually provided under your password. Just click the link, and it will open in a new tab. If you have multiple screens, you can pull the instructions up side by side with the workout. The desktop view from Apache Guacamole is your entry into the workout. There may be several servers in the same workout, but you’ll access them through the same screen.

## Filling in the Assessment

Most workouts will come with an assessment. Follow your instructor’s guidance on these. Some assessments will automatically complete when you have completed certain tasks outlined in the instructions, and some assessment questions require a screenshot.

## Additional Functions

The workout is mostly maintenance-free, but you can perform these actions if needed:

*   **STOP WORKOUT** - If you finish before the workout times out, please click stop. It saves us a few cents :money_mouth_face:

*   **RESET WORKOUT** - This will start and stop your workout in case something is just stuck. It’s rare that you’ll ever need to use this

*   **NUKE WORKOUT** - This does exactly what it says. Bye-bye old workout and hello new workout! You can use this if you’ve firewalled yourself out, deleted your critical system files, or just plain want to start over.

## Common Questions/Issues

1.  **How to Copy/Paste** - On some computers, you can simply right click and paste into the Cyber Gym desktop, but you cannot use Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V. If right-clicking does not work, then you can open the Guacamole control panel by typing Ctrl-Alt-Shift. This gives you access to the desktop clipboard. Anything you copy here will be available on the desktop and vice versa.

2.  **Teeny Guacamole** - In some browsers, the desktop shows up very tiny at the bottom center of the screen. If this occurs, refresh the page. You can also click Ctrl-Alt-Shift, and click settings. Then click back on your username in the top right corner, and click the screen drop down. It _should_ return back to normal size.

3.  **The ENTER YOUR WORKOUT! button never shows** - Keep in mind, it may take up to 10 minutes for the workout to complete startup. Some workouts have a lot of servers that have to start up. If, after 15 minutes, the button still does not show, then let your instructor know something is probably wrong with your workout.
