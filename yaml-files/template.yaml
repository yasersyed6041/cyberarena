# This template provides an overview of the YAML specification for Cyber Gym
# workout configurations. Use this as a basis for creating new YAML config files

# General notes:
# YAML is aware of spacing and tabs. Use tabs to indent sub-entries,
# but only use spaces to separate tags from values.
# a dash ('-') indicates the beginning of a list item. Additional tags and values
# for a list item should be indented. Subsequent list items should begin with a dash.

# Insert basic workout information here.
workout:
  name: # Name
  workout_description: # Enclose this in quotes. Include all relevant description and instructions for the workout here.
  project_name: ualr-cybersecurity
  student_instructions_url:
  teacher_instructions_url:
  region: # data center region -- this should match the desired region in Google Cloud (i.e., "us-central1")
  zone: # data center zone -- this should match the desired zone in Google Cloud (i.e., "us-central1-a")
  dnszone: "cybergym-public"
  project_api_key_type: cloud
  flag_location: # This is used for the flag generation script. Ignore for now.

# List all networks and all subnets here
networks:
  - name: # The network name is arbitrary, but be consistent as this will be referenced by subnets, VMs, routes, and firewall rules
    # Multiple subnets can be listed using YAML block sequence format
    subnets:
      - name: # Subnet name is arbitrary.
        ip-subnet: #Include the full CIDR range for the subnet

# List all VMs required for the workout. Multiple VMs may be listed using YAML block sequence format
servers:
  - name: # Server name is arbitrary
    image: # Use the exact name of the server image from Google Cloud
    machine_type: # Google Cloud VM type (i.e., "n1-standard-1")
    network_routing: # boolean value
    tags: # list tags for this VM (i.e., {items: ["http-server"]})
    metadata: # VM metadata
    # List all nics for this server. Multiple items may be included using YAML block sequence format
    nics:
      - network: # network name
        internal_IP: # VM IP address. Make sure this is within the subnet CIDR range
        subnet: # subnet name
        external_NAT: # boolean value

# List network routes. Multiple routes may be listed using YAML block sequence format.
# If no routes are needed, delete all sub-entries under 'routes:' and leave it empty
routes:
  - name: # route name
    network: # network name
    dest_range: # destination CIDR range
    next_hop_instance: # name of next hop VM

# List all firewall rules. Multiple rules may be listed using YAML block sequence format.
firewall_rules:
  - name: # rule name
    network: # network name
    target_tags: # list of target tags (i.e., ["http-server"])
    protocol: # network protocol
    ports: # list of affected ports (i.e., ["tcp/80,8080,443"])
    source_ranges: # list of source ranges (i.e., ["0.0.0.0/0"])
