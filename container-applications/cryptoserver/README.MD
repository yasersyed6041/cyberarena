# Cryptoserver
This is a web application called, **Johnny Hash** that is used to host multiple cryptographic   
workouts like Caesar ciphers, an introduction to salted and unsalted hashes, and a MD5 CTF
workout.   

The code used to encrypt and decrypt the Caesar ciphers was taken from the Python library, [caesarcipher](https://pypi.org/project/caesarcipher/).
