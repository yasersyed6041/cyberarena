# Pub/Sub Scripts
### This folder contains the code needed to run the pub/sub server

## [ validator.py ]:   
This script is what is used to test creation and deletion of Pub/Sub topics and subscribers.   
Not a final design

---
## [ cg-post.py ]:   
This script can be used with any workout. All that needs to be done is to call the script
from within the respective workout validation script and it will POST a status to the
designated Pub/Sub endpoint.
