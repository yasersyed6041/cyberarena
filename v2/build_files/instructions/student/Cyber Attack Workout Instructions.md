# Cyber Attack Workout Instructions

## Introduction
Welcome to your team's Cyber Attack workout, designed to give you firsthand experience with both the adversary and victim perspectives of a cyber attack involving malware. In this exercise, you'll be introduced to a specific type of malware known as a botnet. A botnet involves a client computer running malicious software that establishes a connection to a central controller. This controller gains control over the victim computer, enabling a range of actions. In this workout, you'll alternate between being a victim of a botnet and controlling one.

## Instructions
1. Log in to your account and locate the "shinobot" icon on the desktop. Double-click on it to initiate the exercise.
2. Once launched, a command prompt window will appear and start executing commands. Look for the host ID and password displayed. It's essential to record these details â€“ either jot them down or take a photo using your phone. If the information scrolls by too quickly, you can scroll back up to capture it.
   - Optional: If you prefer, you can copy and paste the host ID and password. Right-click within the command-line window, select "Mark," highlight the text, right-click again, and choose "Copy." Access the Cyber Gym's clipboard by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Shift, then paste the copied text onto your personal desktop.
3. Open the Chrome browser on your desktop and visit [http://shinobotps1.com/](http://shinobotps1.com/). Navigate to the C&C (Command and Control) tab.
4. Locate the host ID you saved earlier and use the provided credentials to log in.
   - Note: Some networks might block access to the shinobot website or categorize it as malicious. However, this site simulates botnet traffic for educational purposes and doesn't engage in any harmful activities. If you encounter network restrictions, you can access the site through the Cyber Arena desktop.
