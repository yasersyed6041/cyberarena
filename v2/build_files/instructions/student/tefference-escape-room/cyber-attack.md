# Cyber Attack Botnet Instructions
Welcome to your team's Cyber Attack workout, in which you will experience malware from both the adversary and the victim. This workout introduces you to a type of malware known as a botnet. A botnet is a type of malware run on a client computer that establishes a connection back to a botnet controller. The botnet controller can then do almost anything on the victim computer. For this workout, participate as both a victim of a botnet and the controller of one.

## Instructions
1. From the server, double-click shinobot on the desktop.
2. A command prompt opens and immediately starts executing. Look for the host ID and password. You will want to copy these down or take a picture of them with your phone. If the botnet scrolls through, you’ll need to scroll back up and take a picture. 
 > _**Optional:**_ You can copy and paste the host ID and password by right-clicking in the command-line window and selecting Mark. Then select the text and right-click again. You can then access the Cyber Gym’s clipboard by typing Ctrl+Alt+Shift. Then you can copy and paste the text to your personal desktop.
3. Open a Chrome browser inside the server and browse to http://shinobotps1.com/.and then click on the C&C tab
4. Find your host ID that you copied from above and login with the credentials you were provided.

To complete this puzzle, use the ShinoBot command templates and attempt and recover a hidden password.
