## Cyber Attack Workout Guidelines

### Shodan Student Workout Instructions

**Introduction:**
In this workout, you'll be utilizing the Shodan API to access data about unprotected devices connected to the internet. Shodan is a widely used tool that scans the internet for devices lacking proper security configurations, providing information based on header responses. While these devices could theoretically be found via Google searches, Shodan streamlines the process by offering easy access. Security professionals often employ Shodan to identify vulnerable devices or servers that could potentially grant access to clients undergoing security analyses.

It's crucial to understand that using Shodan without explicit consent from the device owner could be considered illegal.

**Your Task:**
To begin, open a new tab and navigate to the URL specified on your Cyber Gym Student landing page.

**Task 1: Search for Minecraft servers in Dallas. What is the organization that owns the server of the 2nd result?**

**Task 2: Search for devices that still use default passwords in the United States. What is the IP address of the server in the first result? (IP format: 35.1.10.34)**

**Task 3: Determine the number of vulnerable Apache servers in Phoenix.**

**Task 4: Identify the count of servers that remain vulnerable to Heartbleed. (Hint: What is Heartbleed?)**

**Task 5: Create your query and provide a screenshot of your most intriguing discovery!**

For more in-depth information, you can delve into raw data by clicking on the "View Raw Data" button. This may reveal details about CVEs present on the page or HTML responses from the server. Take some time to explore the raw data and gain additional insights.

**Please refrain from visiting any URLs or IP addresses uncovered through Shodan results, as some of these sites might contain malware.**
