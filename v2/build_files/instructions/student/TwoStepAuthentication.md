# Two-Step Authentication 

Welcome to the **Two-Step Authentication workout**! This is where you'll learn a simple way to boost the security of your accounts. You know how when you create an account, you use a username and password? Well, if someone sneaky gets these, your account is in trouble. But with two-step authentication, even if they have your password, they'd need an extra secret code to get in.

Now, here's how it works: First, you use your usual username and password. That's **Step 1**. But for **Step 2**, you need something extra, like a special code from an app on your phone. This makes it much harder for bad guys to get into your account.

Let's get started:

1. **Logging into Your Computer:** Go to the Guacamole web server and log in with these:
   - Username: cybergym
   - Password: Let's workout!

   Sometimes, the screen might not show up immediately, so just refresh the page. You'll be logged in automatically.

2. **Your Mission:** Your goal is to access a special web app at [http://10.1.1.33:5000](http://10.1.1.33:5000). This app will guide you through the Two-Step Authentication process.

3. **Setting Up Your Account:** Follow these steps:
   - Register with any username and password you like.
   - You'll see a QR code. Don't worry, it's not as complicated as it sounds. Just think of it like a secret picture.
   - Get an app on your phone called Google Authenticator. This app is like a secret code generator.
   - Use Google Authenticator to "scan" the QR code. It's like taking a picture.
   - Now, whenever you log in, you'll need your regular username, password, and the secret code from Google Authenticator. It's like a triple lock!

4. **Log In:** Give it a try! Use your username, password, and the secret code from the Google Authenticator app. If you get in, you've nailed it!

Remember, this workout is all about making your accounts safer. So, keep using those two steps whenever you can. Nice job!
