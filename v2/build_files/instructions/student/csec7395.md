# CSEC 7395 Practicum Lab
This lab is used for conducting reconnaissance activities on assigned organizations for the practicum course. This lab is provided for your convenience in case you do not have access to computing equipment on which you can run open-source reconnaissance tools.

## Access the Lab Servers
You may access the Windows server by clicking on the Connect button on the student landing page after starting the lab.
> **NOTE: ** You have 2 hours to work on the lab by default. If you think that you will need more time, you may add time in the student landing page after clicking start. Also, remember, the entire cloud lab environment shuts off at midnight to make sure no servers are running. If you are working past midnight, just restart the lab.

The Windows server may also be accessed directly through your local Remote Desktop client using the DNS listed in the lab. When you connect directly, use the username `cyberarena` and contact the instructor for the password.

The Kali server must be accessed through your Windows server in the lab (i.e., winsec-tools). Open the PuTTY shortcut in Desktop --> Tools, and in the Host Name field, type `10.1.1.20`. Then, click _Open_ and use the following credentials:
```
user: student`
password: P@55w0rd!`
```
