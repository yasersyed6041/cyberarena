# CSEC 7395 Practicum Lab
The CSEC 7395 Practicum Lab is dedicated to facilitating reconnaissance activities for the practicum course. If you don't have access to your own computing equipment for running open-source reconnaissance tools, this lab is a perfect resource.

## Access the Lab Servers
You can reach the Windows server by hitting the 'Connect' button on the student landing page. This option is available once you've initiated the lab.

> **NOTE:** By default, you are allowed 2 hours to work on the lab. Should you need additional time, you can extend your session via the student landing page after starting the lab. Keep in mind that the entire cloud lab environment automatically shuts down at midnight to ensure no servers are left running unintentionally. If you find yourself working past midnight, simply restart the lab.

For direct access to the Windows server, you can use your local Remote Desktop client. Simply enter the DNS provided in the lab. To log in, use the username cyberarena and contact the instructor to get the password.

To access the Kali server, you'll need to go through the Windows server in the lab (known as 'winsec-tools'). Navigate to Desktop --> Tools and open the PuTTY shortcut. In the 'Host Name' field, input 10.1.1.20, then click Open. The login credentials are as follows: 
```
user: student`
password: P@55w0rd!`
```
