The UA Little Rock Cyber Gym provides a hands-on cybersecurity lab environment fully built and managed in the 
Google cloud. Once deployed, instructors have access to custom-built workouts in the catalog below or they can create 
their own workouts using yaml specifications. When ready, an instructor initiates a system build for the number of
 students in their class. The build takes roughly 5-10 minutes, and the instructor can then send out an individually 
 generated link for each student. From here students have access to independently turn their workout on and off 
 (Throughout this document, we use the term workout to refer to a cybersecurity lab).

The primary goal of the UA Little Rock cyber gym is to remove barriers that prevent students from participating in 
high-quality cybersecurity attack and defense simulations, and the cost is chief among these barriers. The Cyber Gym 
drastically reduces the cost by making workouts as close to pay-for-use as possible. Workouts are stopped as soon as 
they are created. Students only start cloud resources when they are ready to work, and then all resources are 
automatically turned down when a student is no longer working. This reduces cloud computing costs to the minimum 
necessary for students to perform the mission.

On the student end, we minimize requirements for personal computing and software installation. All workout interaction 
occurs using modern browser capabilities to emulate their connections to high-end computing resources. 

Some schools have additional hurdles because computing environments are administratively locked down to prevent 
software installation and nefarious outbound Internet connections. The Cyber Gym adapts to this environment by 
tunneling all interaction to a named server on the Internet. All traffic goes through named servers on the Internet, 
and named DNS services are automatically created with each new workout. Likewise, firewalls are automatically set up as 
we describe in the technical details section below.

Finally, the cloud resources we use are minimally scaled to provide the necessary service for completing a workout. 
In workouts associated with web attacks and cryptography exercises, this could mean costs as low as a fraction of a 
cent per hour. Whereas other workouts with a full organizational network may cost as much as 30 cents an hour.
