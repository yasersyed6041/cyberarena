            you will need to find the hidden flag within the web page. Programmers and web developers are constantly
            leaving information about different blocks of code inside their web applications. Anyone with access to the
            code can view this information, which are also known as comments, and sometimes, developers can accidentally
            leave sensitive information out in the open. In order to find the flag hidden inside the web source code,
            you will need to use inspect element tool. </p>

            <p style="text-indent:5%;font-size:1em;"> The boss at the Cyber Gym said there are a lot of boxes that
                the interns need to unpack. He told us he was looking for a special item of interest in one of these boxes
                and whoever found it first would be rewarded. When I asked him about the special item, he said we would
                find out once we unpacked and assembled everything in the them. The only problem...the Cyber Gym just
                received all of its new furniture and there are hundreds of boxes. Along with the other interns, I spent
                all day unpacking and assembling desks, computers, chairs, and even this weird shrine to Rick Astley.
                Apparently, that's not the special item of interest and there were a couple of boxes left that were
                labeled &quot;Classified&quot;. After a bit of a brawl with the other interns, we opened one of the
                boxes to reveal a note leading to this web page. It seems we have a couple more boxes to unpack...
