# [ Arena Build Password Attack ]
---   
This workout is used primarily by the CyberGym Arena builds. Currently, the flag is statically created, but future    
implementations will provide dynamic flag creation.    
**7/13/2020**   
- Updated program to allow for dynamic PIN creation. Flag remains static.   
- Fixed issue where 0 could not be the first entered value and where multiple zeroes could not be entered in a row
   
   
### [ NOTE ]:   
In order to modify this workout, developers will need to install and set up QT. QT is a free and   
open-source platform used to build GUI's by extending the C++ language.
