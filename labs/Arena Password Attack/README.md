This workout is used primarily by the CyberGym Arena builds. Currently, the flag is statically created, but future    
implementations will provide dynamic flag creation.    
   
   
### [ NOTE ]:   
In order to modify this workout, developers will need to install and set up QT. QT is free and   
open-source platform used to build GUI's and extend the C++ language.
